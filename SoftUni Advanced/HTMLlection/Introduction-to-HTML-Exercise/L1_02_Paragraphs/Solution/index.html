    <h1>Principles For Clean HTML Code</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Beautiful and clean HTML</strong> is the foundation of a beautiful
      website. When I teach people about CSS, I always begin by telling them
      that good CSS can only exist with equally good HTML markup. A house is
      only as strong as its foundation, right? The advantages of clean, semantic
      HTML are many, yet so many websites suffer from poorly written markup.
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Strict DOCTYPE </strong>. If we are going to do this, let’s just
      do it right. No need for a discussion about whether to use HTML 4.01 or
      XHTML 1.0: both of them offer a strict version that will keep us nice and
      honest as we write our code. <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Character set & encoding characters.</strong>In our &#60;head&#62;
      section, the very first thing should be the declaration of our character
      set. We’re using <strong>UTF-8</strong> here, which is swell, but it’s
      listed after our &#60;title&#62;. Let’s go ahead and move it up so that
      the browser knows what character set it’s dealing with before it starts
      reading any content at all. <br />
      <br />
      The next time you write <strong>HTML</strong>, be it a small chunk in a
      huge website, or the beginning of a fresh new project, just do what you
      can to make <strong>it right</strong>. <br />
